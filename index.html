        <h1>My Background</h1>
        <p>My name is Matt, I like to edit videos and stream my gaming online as acoustechtronica.  I started out editing my videos of my friends and put it to music, and eventually I got into filming short videos and editing in college for Campus Film Fest which entailed filming a short five minute movie in a week.  
        <br>
        My video game streaming has been a hobby for over a decade, and it started out organically in college as well.  A group of my friends would gather weekly and we would spontaneously play games together while others would watch and comment in real time.  When streaming on justin.tv (eventually becoming twitch.tv) became popular, we were enthralled and eventually started our own accounts. Nowadays, I regularly stream weekly as I play either by myself or among friends when we collaborate.
        <br>
        Over time, I've used my video editing experience professionally when working as a contractor with JigReel Studios, and now use it for my personal YouTube channel for fun.  My favorite pastime has been making music videos out of my personal footage and documenting the build of my car as I work on it and add aftermarket parts.  I aspire to make a career out of these hobbies of streaming and editing, and am always open to new work or doing sponsored streams.
