        <p>
        I stream a variety of different types of games, from racing to rhythm games, I enjoy it all.  I enjoy showing my playthroughs of single player games and normally jump between at least two games per stream.  My favorite games have been Metal Gear Solid, Final Fantasy, as well as Call of Duty games, but I've been trying out a diverse range of games. As I acuired a sim racing wheel and electronic drumset, I've been able to stream racing games like Gran Turismo and Assetto Corsa and even DTXmania and Clone Hero on drums.
        <br>
        Recently, I've been collaborating with my friends in games like Helldivers 2, R.E.P.O., and Ready or Not, which have been pretty silly and unserious--but we get the job done.  We try to stream together during weekdays, but weekends are more often the most convenient times to collab.
